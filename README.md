# [AnsiML] - Markup Language for ANSI Colors

AnsiML is a library for inserting [ANSI Colors] into strings, implemented in
TypeScript for [Deno]. Text and colors are strictly separated, thus enabling
semantic operations on ANSI colored text and rendering to different output
formats.

# Introduction

[ANSI colors] are character codes for adding colors to console output. Yet, once
the color codes are mixed with the text, operations on the text become
difficult. Consider these scenarios:

- We want to print colored text with a maximum of 80 columns. If we do not
  handle the color codes while calculating the positions of the line breaks, the
  lines will end up shorter than they need to be.

- We want to print syntax-highlighted source code with colored line numbers to
  the console. Inserting the line numbers into the source might break the parser
  of the syntax highlighter. Inserting the line numbers after syntax
  highlighting might overwrite the colors of the highlighted code.

[AnsiML] solves this with an intermediate representation that keeps color codes
separate from the actual text. It represents colored text as a tree of terminal
string values and non-terminal node objects. Each node object can have a
sequence of color commands, allowing for hierarchical styling of the text. See
the [examples](./examples/) folder for more.

# Features

- Rendering to ANSI colored text, HTML, or plain text.
- JSX runtime for using JSX syntax to create AnsiML trees.
- Generic `stringify` function for custom commands and output formats.
- High-level `Styled` component for nicer dev experience.

# Note on jsx-runtime

The modern way of configuring JSX is via the `jsxImportSource` compiler option,
specified either in the `compilerOptions` section or as a pragma comment. This
can be an URL or bare specifier (defined in an import map). TypeScript will then
append `/jsx-runtime` to this specifier and try to import it as a module. This
module is expected to export the JSX related functions, such as `jsx`, `jsxs`,
and `Fragment`.

Unfortunately, Deno will fail to interpret a module named `jsx-runtime` as a
TypeScript module because it does not end in `.ts` or `.tsx`. The workaround is
to host the module on a CDN that serves the module with the correct MIME type.
In order to run the examples in the repository locally, use
`deno run -A server.ts`.Ã˜
